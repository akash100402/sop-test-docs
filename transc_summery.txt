project 1: Project Helios

--> its a centralized customer intelligence platform

objective: 

Its objective is to unify real-time behavioral data from six disparate sources—web, mobile app, partner APIs, support tickets, transaction logs, and IoT streams—into a single, queryable customer profile.

Right now, customer information is scattered everywhere—like having someone’s Instagram, email, purchase history, and support chats all in different places with no way to see them together.

Helios brings all that scattered info into one dashboard in real time, so the company can instantly know everything about a customer the moment they interact and provide personalized products they like.

real time example

Scenario:
Sarah is shopping online for a laptop on her phone.

Step-by-Step Real-Time Flow
1. Data Collection
Sarah:

Visits the website → Web stream

Logs into her account → Mobile app stream

Adds laptop to cart → Transaction log

Chats with support about warranty → Support ticket

Pays using her saved card → Partner API (payment gateway)

Has a smartwatch tracking her activity → IoT stream


give suggession based on her data combined

project 2: Project Aegis

--> its a real-time compliance orchestration engine

objective: 

Automate real-time compliance checks for cross-border digital transactions under regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and APAC data frameworks. 

1. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
2. CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
3. APAC (Asia-Pacific Region)

Real-Time Example:
A customer in Germany buys digital software from a company in California.

Transaction submitted → enters Aegis Ingestion Gateway.

The system assigns it an Aegis ID and sends it to Kafka.

The Rules Engine pulls in GDPR rules for Germany and CCPA for California.

It checks:

Did the user consent to data sharing?

Is the payment method compliant with APAC rules if the bank is in Singapore?

Is the transaction amount within legal limits?

Engine calculates a Compliance Score.

If score is below 95%, it’s flagged for Human Review Dashboard.

If approved, the transaction proceeds instantly; if not, it’s blocked or flagged for legal review.
